# terminal ui startpage

## startpage for your browser inspired by the terminal aesthetic because why not

I just wanted to have a startpage for my browser that references websites that i use and using vim motion commands to navigate through it pretty easily and fast.

Update the list in constants/websites.ts to change the websites displayed.
